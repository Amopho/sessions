      A VTT file is a text file saved in the Web Video Text Tracks (WebVTT) format. It contains supplementary information about a web video, including subtitles, captions, descriptions, chapters, and metadata.</p>

          <h1>:current</h1> selector is called a "time-dimensional" pseudo-class that represents
          the element, or an ancestor of the element, that is currently being
          displayed.<br>
          Examples:
          <ul>
              <li>selecting a time-dimensional relative element during a speech rendering</li>
              <li>displaying video subtitles</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h1>::cue</h1> is a pseudo-element that matches WebVTT cues (subtitle text) within a selected element<br>
            Examples:
            <ul>
                <li>may be used to style captions </li>
            </ul>
            The properties are applied to the entire set of cues as if they were a single unit. The only exception is that background and its longhand properties apply to each cue individually, to avoid creating boxes and obscuring unexpectedly large areas of the media.
